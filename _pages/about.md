I’m a B.Sc. graduate in Computer Engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology. My research interests include natural language processing, machine learning and deep learning, information retrieval and data mining. I’m always eager to collaborate on projects or research opportunities that align with my expertise. If you’d like to connect or discuss potential collaborations, feel free to reach out!

### Outside academia
I hit the gym regularly and enjoy keeping a steady training and diet routine. I like learning English as a hobby and following content in English to keep improving.

## Research Experience
### ReAct-Enhanced RAG Framework for Financial Document Question Answering — Bachelor Thesis, IUST (Sep 2024 – Apr 2025)
- Designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system for SEC filings using large language models and recursive chunking.
- Built RAPTOR hierarchical indexing for scalable retrieval and summarization.
- Integrated a LangGraph-based ReAct agent to iteratively reason over multi-source evidence.
- Improved query relevance with expansion and cross-encoder re-ranking.

### NLP-based Financial Forecasting: Market-Aware Textual Representation of Tweets — Undergraduate Internship, IUST (Feb 2024 – Jul 2024)
- Developed topic modeling to cluster market-related tweets with NLP and transformer-based embeddings.
- Applied temporal enrichment to maintain representation fidelity for short-term market impact.
- Implemented optimized triple-barrier labeling and tuned LSTM models for next-day market prediction.
